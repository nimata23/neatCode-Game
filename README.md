# neatCode-Game
We seek to add to the research on gamification in software engineering education by creating a game called neatCode. neatCode provides a simple platform for entry-level students to practice coding style, focusing on the accurate and concise naming of methods. This game introduces competition through the use of a scoreboard and students gain points based on the similarity of their method name to gold standard name selected by the researchers. Students are then ranked according to their game score and high ranking players are placed on a leader board. The game includes levels of varying difficulty which helps to account for student progress over time. We expect interaction with neatCode will increase student engagement in learning and improve the quality of method names written by students when compared traditional learning methods or use of other tools for learning code style.
